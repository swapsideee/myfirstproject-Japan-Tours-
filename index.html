          <div class="main-information">
            <p>Japan is not the most popular destination for tourism, but it is an amazing country full of contrasts and
              contradictions. Here life flows rapidly and at the same time the influence of traditions is strong, nature
              gives peace and tranquility. Here more often go already experienced travelers who have visited more than
              one
              country.</p>

            <p>Budget vacation and the Land of the Rising Sun are incompatible concepts. There is no concept of “low
              season”, prices are always high, but everyone who has been to this country, unequivocally say that it is
              worth going here. The sights of Japan will surprise even a sophisticated tourist. There is a lot to see
              here
              both on your first visit and on your next visits, because it is almost impossible to cover everything.

              <h4><b>Mount Fuji</b></h4>
              <p>If we consider the natural attractions of Japan, Fuji is the main one. The Japanese consider it sacred
                and therefore build temples on its slopes. It is located 100 kilometers from Tokyo, but despite this,
                its
                top with a cap of snow is visible from the capital. It is a weakly active volcano whose last eruption
                was
                more than 300 years ago.</p>
              <p>It takes about 6 hours to climb to the top of Mount Fujiyama, but the mountain is only open to the
                public
                during the summer months (except June). Tourists who are in the mood to conquer this height should take
                care of warm shoes and clothes - the mountain, despite the summer, is cool.</p>

                <h4><b>Sagano Bamboo Grove</b></h4>
                <p>It was created in the XIV century by Japanese poet and monk Muso Soseki. It is a peculiar alley
                  formed
                  by
                  slender tall bamboo trees, a mysterious, a bit fairy-tale, mesmerizing world. The enchanting music
                  that
                  comes from the contact of the wind with the bamboo stalks sounds here all the time. These sounds are
                  soothing and peaceful. The Japanese believe that bamboo protects people from evil spirits. The area of
                  the
                  grove (or, as it is also called, bamboo forest) is 16 square kilometers, there are many footpaths.
                  Bamboo
                  grows very fast: it takes only a month to reach 20 meters. The height of some stems is even 40 meters,
                  and
                  the diameter is more than 30 centimeters. In addition to the bamboo, there is a pond in the grove,
                  with
                  temple buildings on the left side of the pond.</p>
                <p>It only takes half an hour to get here from Kyoto.</p>

                <h4><b>Blue Pond on Hokkaido Island</b></h4>
                <p>Remembering the most colorful sights of Japan, you can not ignore this body of water. It appeared at
                  the
                  end of the last century and got its name due to the saturated shade of water. Dazzling blueness of the
                  water surface bewitches, you can look at it endlessly, from different angles it seems dark, light,
                  transparent. Scientists say that the water of the pond is saturated with aluminum salts, giving it a
                  unique shade. The blue water surface is contrasted by withered tree trunks sticking out of it.</p>
                <p>The pond is especially beautiful in winter, under a thin crust of ice and light first snow it looks
                  magical.</p>

                <p>It is located in Hitatinaka on the shores of the Pacific Ocean. It is a unique place: it changes
                  color
                  every season, so it is interesting to come here at any time of the year. The park has a huge territory
                  filled with different colors: lilies, tulips, daffodils, poppies, sakura, and forget-me-nots grow
                  here.
                  Each plant paints the park in its own color, spreading endless carpets of yellow, pink, blue, green
                  and
                  other shades.</p>

                  southernmost Japanese national park. Getting here is not easy: the sea journey from Tokyo will take
                  more
                  than a day (about 30 hours), but you will not regret the trip: the natural attractions of Japan in
                  these
                  places are simply fascinating. Densely forested islands of volcanic origin, created by nature itself,
                  have
                  bizarre shapes, cliffs rise above the water surface. All this creates unique conditions for the

                <h4><b>Todai-ji Temple</b></h4>
                <p>Located within walking distance of the city center, in a park, it is Nara's most popular tourist
                  attraction and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Todai-ji, as well as Kofuku-ji and Horyu-ji make up the
                  “Big
                  Three” must-see attractions in Nara. This is a city that is a collection of interesting sights in
                  Japan,
                  and there are more than 500 places that are sacred to the Japanese. Todai-ji Temple is a complex of
                  buildings that includes the world's largest wooden structure, built in 743, which houses a gilded
                  15-meter

                <h4><b>Fushimi Inari Shrine </b></h4>
                <p>Located in Kyoto Prefecture. It is built in honor of the female deities Inari. It is believed that
                  they
                  are responsible for the harvest of rice, tea, business prosperity, success in education and even
                  successful childbirth. There are more than 30 thousand such temples in Japan.</p>
                <p>Those who want to enter the temple have to climb a staircase with many steps. On the way there are
                  many
                  gates set up through which one must pass. All of them have been donated to the shrine by businessmen,
                  who
                  in this way try to attract success in business.</p>

                <h4><b>Himeji Castle</b></h4>
                <p>Located at the foot of Mount Hime, literally an hour and a half drive from Osaka. This ancient
                  structure
                  is the oldest castle in Japan (its history dates back to the 14th century). The snow-white building
                  with
                  traditional curved roofs does resemble a graceful bird against the sky. Initially the castle was built
                  and
                  used as a defensive structure, but looking at its outline, this is not even very believable. Today it
                  is
                  a
                  UNESCO heritage site.</p>
                <p>The castle complex has a total of 83 structures, almost all of them made of wood. There is a deep
                  moat,
                  defense towers and a luxurious garden.</p>
